Application UI Design Principles: 

- Consistency: We implemented a consistent navbar on all the pages of our site. We incorporated feedback from A1 to remove the login button in the navbar once the user has logged in.

- Tolerance Principle: User Control and Freedom: For each visualization we have incorporated a back button so that 
    if the user clicks on the wrong visualization, he/she can go back to select the correct visualization.

- Simplicity Principle: When sorting the D3JS visualizations, the sort button only allows ONE click. The button is 
    disabled after a single click and the user is no longer allowed to click on the button.

- Feedback Principle: Visual spinner when loading SVG visualization
